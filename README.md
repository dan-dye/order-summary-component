## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma design

### What I learned

This project was very similar to the [first](https://github.com/dan-dye/stats-preview-card-component) Frontend Mentor course I did so I used the opportunity to reinforce my process for developing a Flexbox card. One of the things I wanted to try was using mobile-first workflow which I found to be easier than scaling down from the desktop version. I also gained a lot of familiarity with using a Figma design to find CSS styles rather than trying to guess the correct size of elements. I was able to complete this project in a morning rather than over several days which I think is due to me becoming more comfortable using Flexbox.

```

### Continued development

I may try and revisit this project using CSS Grid and/or Sass.
